# .net-core-api

This is my sample application to learn .net core api.
I am trying to create a API on Northwind database. 

This uses:

1. .Net Core
2. EF Core
3. AutoMapper
4. Swagger
5. NLog

Following will be done as part of this project:

1. Authentication
2. Model validations
3. Basic CRUD operations on entities
4. Swagger documentation
5. Integration Tests
